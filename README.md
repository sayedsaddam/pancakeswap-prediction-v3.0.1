#### Advice:
  
- Run the bot with your wallet at a ratio of 10x the amount you choose to bet
- Adjust the bot accordingly to bet with or against the majority.
- When the chart swings, use the "--with" strategy.
- When the chart trends sideways, use the default, against strategy. 
- Always monitor & adjust the bot accordingly but allow room for error.
- Consistent gains will be made by running smaller betting amounts over longer periods of time. 
- Always account & allow room for error. Losing 3 sucks, but stopping it only prevents it from potentially winning the next 4 & bringing you to a profit. 
- Majority of the runs with over 2k plays I have a standard 54-66% win rate depending on how well I monitor it & based on market conditions.
